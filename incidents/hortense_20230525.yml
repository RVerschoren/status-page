  <p>We are observing crashing Slurm daemons, which are resulting in workernodes being unavailable for running jobs.</p>

  <p>Slurm output files for jobs may be missing for jobs that completed while the Slurm daemon the the workernode was down at that time.</p>

  <p>The problem is actively being investigated by the HPC-UGent team.<br/>
  We will try and resolve the problems as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Update Thu 25 May 2023, 14:30: A workaround has been put in place to mitigate the impact of this issue,
  until a proper fix is available.</p>
