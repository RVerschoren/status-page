  The Tier-1 webportal and compute nodes were unavailable for all users with a vsc4xxxx style vsc-id.
  Both were affected by the unavailability of NFS links to the UGent Tier-2 shared storage, which is currently down for maintenance.
  Problems have been fixed, Tier-1 Compute Hortense is again fully functional for all vsc4xxxx users.
