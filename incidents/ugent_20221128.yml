  The Tier-1 webportal is currently unavailable for all users with a vsc4xxxx style vsc-id.
  This is related to the scheduled maintenance of the HPC-UGent Tier-2 infrastructure.
  The Tier-1 webportal is affected by the unavailability of NFS links to the UGent Tier-2 shared storage.
  At the very latest, the portal should be back available by Wednesday 30 Nov 2022, 9h00.
  Efforts are ongoing to provide a work-around by an earlier time.
