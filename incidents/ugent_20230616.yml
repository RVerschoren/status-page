  <p>
  An unexpected power outage has occurred in the UGent datacenter S10 around 02:50 on Friday 16 June 2023.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a result of this, most of the HPC-UGent and VSC infrastructure housed in the UGent datacenter
  is currently down.<br/>
  This includes VSC Tier-1 Hortense (incl. login nodes and scratch storage), Tier-1 cloud,
  and all HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters.
  </p>
  <p>
  We are working on mitigating the problems, and making all infrastructure available again as soon as possible.
