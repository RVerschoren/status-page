  <p>
  An unexpected power outage has occurred in the Ghent area which also affected the UGent datacenter S10
  around 02:50 CEST on Friday 16 June 2023.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a result of this, most of the HPC-UGent and VSC infrastructure housed in the UGent datacenter
  became unavailable.<br/>
  This included:
  <ul>
  <li>VSC Tier-1 Hortense, including login nodes and scratch storage;</li>
  <li>The Tier-1 cloud infrastructure that is not on backup power</li>
  <li>All HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters;</li>
  <li>Home directories for VSC accounts affiliated with UGent;</li>
  <li>HPC-UGent shared filesystems ($VSC_DATA, $VSC_SCRATCH);</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  Problems with the Tier-1 cloud infrastructure were fixed by 10:10 CEST.
  </p>
  <p>
  The HPC-UGent Tier-2 infrastructure and Tier-1 Hortense were fully operational again around 14:00 CEST.
  </p>
  <p>
  The login nodes, web portal, and Globus service nodes for both the HPC-UGent Tier-2 infrastructure
  and Tier-1 Hortense were rebooted in the process, to eliminate any problems caused by the shared filesystems
  ($VSC_HOME, $VSC_DATA, $VSC_SCRATCH) being unavailable for a while (roughly between 02:50 and 10:00 CEST).
