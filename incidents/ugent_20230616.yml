  <p>
  An unexpected power outage has occurred in the UGent datacenter S10 around 02:50 CEST on Friday 16 June 2023.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a result of this, most of the HPC-UGent and VSC infrastructure housed in the UGent datacenter
  is currently down.<br/>
  This includes:
  <ul>
  <li>VSC Tier-1 Hortense, including login nodes and scratch storage;</li>
  <li>The Tier-1 cloud infrastructure <strong>(problems fixed now, since 10:10 CEST)</strong>;</li>
  <li>All HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters;</li>
  <li>Home directories for VSC accounts affiliated with UGent;</li>
  <li>HPC-UGent shared filesystems ($VSC_DATA, $VSC_SCRATCH);</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  We are working on mitigating the problems, and making all infrastructure available again as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update 09:45</strong><br/>
  Access to HPC-UGent Tier-2 login nodes is now closed, while we mitigate the problems with the HPC-UGent shared filesystems.
