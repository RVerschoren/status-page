  Scheduled maintenance work to HPC-UGent Tier-2 systems (28 November - 2 December 2022)
  
  Will be unavailable during this period:
  
  * all HPC-UGent Tier-2 login nodes
  
  * all HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters
  
  * the shared storage (`$VSC_HOME`, `$VSC_DATA`, `$VSC_SCRATCH*`)
    
  We will mainly perform updates in this maintenance window, including firmware, shared filesystems, OS, Slurm, and the central software stack provided through modules.
