  <p>Another downtime of the entire Tier1 Hortense system is needed.</p>
  <p>Purpose is to bring online a more powerful cooling system for Tier1 Hortense.</p>
  <p>We anticipate this will bring more stability to the system.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>All login nodes, all compute nodes, and the shared scratch filesystem will be offline.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Update 26/06/2023: for the moment, the login nodes and shared scratch filesystem can remain online during the maintenance works. However, the schedulers are paused with no jobs currently running on Tier1.</p>
