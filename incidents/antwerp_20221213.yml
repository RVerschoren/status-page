  We schedule a downtime for all CalcUA clusters and our storage infrastructure between Friday 16 December, 4 pm, and Monday 19 December, noon
  (expected).<br />
  This is needed due to a scheduled intervention on the CGB high-voltage cabin on Saturday.

  Access to other VSC sites (both Tier-2 and Tier-1) will not be possible, since our storage will be down.<br />


  Our apologies for the inconvenience.
