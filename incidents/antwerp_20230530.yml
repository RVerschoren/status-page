  <p>An extension to Vaughan will be installed, adding 40 compute nodes and some extra storage.<br/>
  The installation involves adding an extra rack, two inrow coolers, and additional fuses in the electric board.</p>
 
  <p>We have put a reservation on the compute nodes, starting Wednesday, May 31, 8 am.<br/>
  Because of the works in the electric board, we need to power down both storage and clusters on Thursday, June 1.<br/>
  As soon as these works have been approved by the inspection company, the storage and clusters will be started up again.<br/>
  We hope to have everything up and running again on Friday, June 2.</p>
 
  <p>During the downtime, no jobs can be run on any of the VSC Tier-2 clusters.<br/>
  Access to VSC Tier-1 will be possible if it does not involve accessing the antwerpen storage mounts.</p>

  <p>Access to other VSC sites (both Tier-2 and Tier-1) will not be possible in the same time window.</p>
