  <p>We schedule a downtime for all CalcUA clusters and our storage infrastructure between Tuesday 18 April, 7 am, and Wednesday 19 April, evening.<br/>

  This is needed due to a shutdown of the cooling system to add additional piping for the upcoming Vaughan extension.</p>

  <p>Access to other VSC sites (both Tier-2 and Tier-1) will not be possible in the same time window.</p>

  <p>Our apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
