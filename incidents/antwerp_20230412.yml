  <p><strong>Update Wed 20 April 2023 - 11:30</strong> We have decided to further extend the downtime until Thursday 5 pm.</p>

  <p><strong>Update Wed 19 April 2023 - 15:30</strong> Because of issues with the cooling, we have decided to extend the downtime until Thursday 12 pm (noon).</p>

  <p><strong>Original message:</strong><br/>
  We schedule a downtime for all CalcUA clusters and our storage infrastructure between Tuesday 18 April, 7 am, and Wednesday 19 April, evening.<br/>

  This is needed due to a shutdown of the cooling system to add additional piping for the upcoming Vaughan extension.</p>

  <p>Access to other VSC sites (both Tier-2 and Tier-1) will not be possible in the same time window.</p>

  <p>Our apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
