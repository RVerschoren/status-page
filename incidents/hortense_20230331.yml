  <p>Repairs will be done to the existing nodes and preparatory work is planned to the datacenter and hardware in view of the second phase of Tier-1 Hortense.<br/>
  Impacted: all login nodes, all compute nodes and the shared scratch filesystem will be offline.</p>
  
  <p>As a next step towards integrating the second phase of Tier1 Hortense, we have to schedule another maintenance window.<br/>
  Please already take this into account when planning your further computational experiments.
  The works involve a.o.:
  <ul>
  <li>more extensive testing of phase2 hardware</li>
  <li>making sure that cooling systems can feed phase 1+2 in a stable fashion</li>
  <li>further configuration of the scratch storage system extension</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Impacted: all login nodes, all compute nodes, and the shared scratch filesystem will be offline.</p>
