  Repairs will be done to the existing nodes and preparatory work is planned to the datacenter and hardware in view of the second phase of Tier-1 Hortense.
  Impacted: all login nodes, all compute nodes and the shared scratch filesystem will be offline.
  
  As a next step towards integrating the second phase of Tier1 Hortense, we have to schedule another maintenance window.
  Please already take this into account when planning your further computational experiments.
  The works involve a.o.:
    - more extensive testing of phase2 hardware
    - making sure that cooling systems can feed phase 1+2 in a stable fashion
    - further configuration of the scratch storage system extension

  Impacted: all login nodes, all compute nodes, and the shared scratch filesystem will be offline.
