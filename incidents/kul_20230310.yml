  Shutdown JupyterHub nodes

  The JupyterHub service that has been hosted on our Tier-2 cluster will be permanently closed down on 17/03/2023. This service will be
  completely replaced by the JupyterLab interactive app that is available in our Open Ondemand (https://ondemand.hpc.kuleuven.be/).

  You should be able to see and use your existing kernels in JupyterLab immediately. All of your storage is available there as well, so
  you should also be able to open and use your notebooks without any issue.

  Note that Open Ondemand only runs on wICE, so you will need to use Slurm credits to start a session.
