  <p><strong>Update Mon 26 June 2023 - 10:00</strong> The storage infrastructure and compute nodes are accessible again. We are still experiencing some issues with the Leibniz login nodes, so please log in via the Hopper (`login-hopper.hpc.uantwerpen.be`) or Vaughan login nodes (`login-vaughan.hpc.uantwerpen.be`).</p>

  <p><strong>Original message:</strong> An unscheduled power interruption caused our infrastructure to go down.</p>

  <p>At the moment of writing, no systems are accessible, including our storage infrastructure. This means that access to other VSC sites (both Tier-2 and Tier-1) is not possible.</p>

  <p>Our apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
