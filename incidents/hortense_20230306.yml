  <p>A maintenance period is required to expand Tier-1 Hortense with (much) more hardware, roughly doubling the capacity of the system.</p>

  <p><strong>Impacted:</strong> all login nodes, all compute nodes and the shared scratch filesystem will be offline.</p>

  <p><strong>Update Fri 10 March 2023 - 15:00</strong></p>

  <p>
  Unfortunately, maintenance work to Tier-1 Hortense is not completed yet.
  Currently, the machine is not yet released by the vendor.
  After that, still quite a bit of validating work and stress testing is needed before we can safely release the cluster.

  We expect to be able and release a stable system in the course of next week.
  It goes without saying that we are trying our best to speed up availability for the users as much as possible.
