  Tier-2 NX server upgrade
    
    * We will perform an upgrade of the Tier-2 (Genius) NX server on Wednesday evening (Dec 21), starting from 5pm at the earliest. As this will shut down any open NX sessions, you may want to save your work and gracefully close your open applications.

    * We expect that you will be able to use the Tier-2 NX the following day (i.e. Thursday morning).
